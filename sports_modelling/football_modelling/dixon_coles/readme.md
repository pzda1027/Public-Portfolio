Football modelling

The Dixon-Coles football prediction model was first published in 1997
by Mark J Dixon and Stuart G Coles. The paper built upon a basic
poisson model but included two extra improvements. 

- Tried to solve the issue of under reporting low scoring games
- Include a time delay to give more weight to more recent results.

There's lots of really good information out there about the 
Dixon-Coles method if you fancy some more information.

Betting websites will have infinitely better models than someone
on their own can create. That's where picking leagues where there
will be more edge on predictions. Edge is where the model you create
shows lower odds than a betting website. Be careful though, it could
be due to variois injuries on a team etc.
