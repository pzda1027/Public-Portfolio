This is a project that I've recently started so is a huge work in progress!

I am using an app called "Merlin" which is run by the Cornell Lab where you
record bird calls in the area and then uses machine learning to figure out
which bird call the app is recording. 

As I said at the top this is still a work in progress and I'll be adding to
it in the future. However, it does show the use of a folium heat map with
markers!

Any questions let me know!
