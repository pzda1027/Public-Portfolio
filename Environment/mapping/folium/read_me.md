This is a little side project of mine using the app called "Merlin".
It is run by the Cornell Lab and analyses bird calls and uses machine
learning to guess the bird call. Feel free to open the jupyter notebook
and run it!

I've taken various recordings when I can and I've added them to a 
folium heatmap included markers with what birds are in that location.

This is a work in progress and I will be updating it so hopefully
it'll be more there just a few points!

Any questions let me know!
